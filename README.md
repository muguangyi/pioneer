# Pioneer

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/s49oscdiivqkl5x7?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/muguangyi/pioneer)

ETCS with network sync framework in pure C#.

ETCS (`Entity` + `Trait` + `Control` + `System`) could compose different development solutions:

* `Entity` + `Trait` + `System` equals ECS pattern.
* `Entity` + `Trait` + `Control` equals GameObject and Component pattern in Unity.

Of cause you could compose two type patterns in one project as you like.
